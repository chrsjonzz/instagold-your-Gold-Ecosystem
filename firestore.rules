/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for InstaGold.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only
 * access their own data and create/manage ratings associated with their accounts.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.  Only the authenticated user can
 *   read or write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/ratings/{ratingId}: Stores ratings and reviews created by
 *   a specific user.  Only the creating user can modify or delete these ratings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to prevent information harvesting.
 * - All write operations require an authenticated user.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document data is enforced for user IDs.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'Rating' documents under `/users/{userId}/ratings/{ratingId}` contain a 'userId'
 * field that is redundant with the path. This denormalization is intentional
 * to allow for potential future rule changes or data migrations without breaking
 * existing security constraints.  Currently, the path is still the primary
 * source of truth for ownership.
